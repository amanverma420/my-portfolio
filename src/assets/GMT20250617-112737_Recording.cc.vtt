Hi, sir, good evening.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Guys, I have been assigned this session. Tojo session, Lunga, and… It will be, uh, on, you know, some aspects.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Basically calling the basics. Setting of foundations for the other sessions. I'll take this, uh, class.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Yeah, we'll just wait for, uh, 2-3 minutes and, uh, let others join, then we'll start.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Good evening, sir.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Good evening, Bumi.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Okay, uh, till the time we're starting, uh, how many of you post regularly on LinkedIn. Just do a thumbs up.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Okay. Okay. How many of you post regularly on LinkedIn?

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Okay. Uh, the next question is, uh, how many, uh, of you have not… even created your account on LinkedIn.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Just… just asking, just asking.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Yes, sir, um, LinkedIn.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Okay, okay, take care. Uh, okay.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Uh, how many, uh… uses… use, uh, Instagram.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Daily. Just a thumbs up.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Um, 15… 15 minutes only.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Okay, okay. Take care. Okay. Cheering.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Good evening, sir.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:40.000
I think people are here, uh… We'll wait for just one more minute, and then we'll start. Guys, uh, your sessions will start sharp, uh, at the given time. So, from next time, please join on time. Uh, we'll not fail

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Wait for anyone. Uh, the scheduled time is what the time is, and it will start sharp at, let's say, 6 or 5 Jobyapka time.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Ticket. Jalo, I'll start. The very first thing, uh… Yeah. So, uh, we use… Laptops Daily, uh, systems daily, and we type a lot of content.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:11.000
And throughout our life, uh, we'll be typing a lot of documents, a lot of, you know, post.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Code everything. And eventually, you will be working with keyboard all your life.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:26.000
And just to give you some context, most of the MBAs, they spend their whole life own… Google Docs, or MS Word.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Or just a Google Sheets. Analyzing them, making reports.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Just… that sort. However, the use case, uh, might be different, can be different. Kco domain har kisi ka, apna area of Bakote hai.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:50.000
But, you know, they will be using the same tools. And at the core, we have this laptop, uh, this keyboard.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:56.000
And just to attach it with the other thing, you basically write with your pen.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:01.000
On a piece of paper. So, if you don't know how to write better.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:11.000
How to write faster. So, how will you be able to write, you know, number of pages? How will you be able to give exams and complete it on time?

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Basically, what I mean to say here is that you will be working on keyboard throughout your Life. So, why not, uh increase our speed.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:39.000
On keyboard. So, uh, there are some platforms that we use, and that I, uh, personally, uh, prefer. One is typing.com. I'll just show you This over my screen.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Yeah. Okay, I'll share my screen, and then we'll start from there.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Just let me know if screen is visible to everyone. Yeah. I hope it is visible to everyone.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Yes, sir.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Okay, uh, just a second.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Yes, sir.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Just a second.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:24.000
One sec… yeah. Okay. Okay. So, uh, I'll move to this platform.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Uh, typing.com.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:38.000
And from now onwards, like, for this whole month. You will be typing daily on this platform.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:45.000
You are free to use other platforms, Typing Master, uh, XYZ Type, there are many platforms.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:08:03.000
But on this, you will log in as a student. I'll also log in as a student here And… I'll use my Google account, and let's say, uh… I'll use this one.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:11.000
And that's Linda. Okay.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Yeah. So, a long time back, I, uh, used this platform.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:25.000
And the benefit is that eventually, uh, you will become a master of your keyboard. You will become a master of your pen.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:35.000
That you're using to write on a piece of paper. So you basically, aapko bhi start karna hai, from… 17th June, Juki Ajay.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
And you'll be spending here at least 10 minutes every day.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Just for 5 to 10 minutes, just right. I basically tell this to all the students who joined my first class, and how to start, uh, you can start by the… just… you know, starting the first module, or you will find the start here.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Then start. And this page will pop up.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Yes, you will watch this video, but for now, I'll just skip this video.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:16.000
And then you have to type. We have to use the right… We have to place this on J, K, L, and semicolon.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:30.000
And this thumb-on space. Similarly, A, S, D, F. Ticket. And, uh, if you can just, uh, feel the F and… JK, F and J.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Just feel the bumps on this key, uh… Only these keys have these bumps. Why? Because if even I close my eyes, and I just know, uh… put my hand on keyboard. So, I'm able to identify F and J.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:55.000
But there is… and once… I identify F and J, then… Automatically, I identified DSA.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:02.000
And then KL semicolon. And now I can access my whole keyboard. I can type, you know, without looking at the keyboard.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Okay, so just to continue, I'll press J, Enter. And then… Jesus.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:16.000
And there are these, uh, small, small exercises that will, you know, keep on going, uh, building, uh.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Our foundations, and then, ultimately, our speed. For now, please don't focus on the speed.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Just focus on the accuracy. That you're pressing right keys with the right fingers.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:34.000
To get FSS, G, F, S, F? G.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Please, for now, don't focus on the, uh, speed. Eventually, speed will come.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:51.000
It will build up. Focus on the accuracy part, because, you know, just, uh… we humans, we want to learn faster.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.000
And how many patients near.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:11:03.000
But over… period of month… one month, you will have very good speed, uh, like, above 40p. 40 WPM.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Even 50 WPM. Wpm is words per minute, and you will be able to type those words easily. One benefit is that, of course, you will use keywords Throughout your life, so better use… pen, your keyboard, uh, you know, right?

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Right away. The other, uh, benefit is that this speed is required in many jobs.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Uh, just to give you some more context, for example, any coding round of any company, you will have to type a lot.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:41.000
And if your speed is not good, so eventually you will be failing that round. Okay?

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Then, the third part. Oh, okay, uh… one industry is requiring, and then in many government jobs, if any one of you is planning to go for government jobs.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:57.000
For those as well, the speed is required. A particular speed is required.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:10.000
So, the speed is must. And the third, uh, that is kind of personal, that you will gain some kind of confidence after completing these small, small exercises.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Just, uh, Igwara be, uh, just login karlo appneh platform page, just open a new tab.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:21.000
And I'll give you just 2 minutes. Open a new tab, uh, open this platform, typing.com.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:36.000
And Logan, and just complete at least one for now. Um, since I'm not able to witness your screen, but let's say we'll keep this confidence, uh, we'll have this faith that you will be whatever, uh.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.000
The mentor will say in the meeting. Otherwise, uh… Yeah, please.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Excuse me, sir? So, could you please just show from the beginning how to open typing.com and start typing? Because I missed out a little bit.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Okay. Okay, okay, I'll… I'll open a new incognito window.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Uh, first open your browser. Browser is basically a way to access the internet, and then you have to… uh, type, typing.com On the platform. And then, create your account, either you sign up or just do a login directly. Login.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Looking at the student, and you can use your Gmail account, uh, Google account.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Or you can create a new account from scratch. I will use my Gmail account, and it will, uh, use authentication by Google.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:34.000
And then you'll be logged in. And then your home screen will be like this.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Like this. But, uh… Since, yeah, all your, uh… This, uh… Boxes will be white. Since you are logging in for the first time.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:53.000
And then you will see a button here start. Take care. Start.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:57.000
If you see my typing time, it is showing, uh, 13.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:06.000
10, 14. That means 13 hours of typing. I just type frequently, uh, like, if there, uh.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:15.000
If a good gap comes, let's say, let's say 2-3 weeks, 4 weeks, then if I want to start something new, if I want to learn something new.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:21.000
So, before doing all that, I start typing, because it makes you feel good, it makes you feel kind of achieved.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:44.000
That you've achieved something. Just take a… and then open first exercise, and then… So, this is, uh… One of the tasks that you will be doing every day throughout this internship. That you complete all these tasks in single day, and then you will become master. Muscle memory nahi banner gi. Your muscle memory will not form.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:15:01.000
So, you have to type every day for a month. Okay, and eventually speed will pick up. You will pick up, uh… the speed. Okay, one is this platform. The other one is, uh… Yeah.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Yeah.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:09.000
So… Sir, I'm sorry to interrupt you again, but could you please show where exactly in this one typing, uh, typing.com opens, where exactly we need to go to start typing?

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:12.000
In that same page.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Let's see, uh… okay. This is the homepage that will open. First, you have to log in. I think I've shown you just a minute before. Login into account.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Mm-hmm.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:29.000
And then this home will open in the lessons tab. Then there are some tests also, tests as well, then some games.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Typing games, which you can, you know. Uh, you can take this test, and then you can also play this typing games, just for practice.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:47.000
So, under this lessons, you will find the lessons… these lessons.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Okay. Uh…

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Okay? Yeah, okay. Then the other path… Once you open the, uh, this link in the laptop, do you turn it on, and then you will see where exactly the things exist.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:09.000
The other one is KBR. Qbr, K EYBR.com. This platform is also good. It makes you… type, you know, words repeatedly.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:18.000
You will type a particular word, you know, and number of times, and then the muscle memory will form. For example, I'll just start typing.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Yeah. Click, and it is… Line 9… W-E-R-I-E, N-E-A-R-C-R.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Rdr. Yeah. So you… it will… Yep, we are Amit.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Again, please, uh, screen pay annotate madkaro. Badne magi gem kilhenge. Abhi kilim, please madkar.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:58.000
Because KBR is, uh… Well, is another platform, and it will help you, uh, type one word multiple times, and eventually you will build muscle memory.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:10.000
And eventually, your typing speed will increase.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Mute, yeah. Okay, so this is the very first task that you will be performing throughout this summer school.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Then, uh, moving on to the… I hope this is clear.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:30.000
If there's in doubt, just type in the chat box. And if, uh, others can help, please, uh, help the… help your peers. Take care.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:37.000
Since some of you will be grabbing things faster. Yeah. Okay.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:42.000
Yeah, monkey type, rudder type. Xyz type, there are so many platforms.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:48.000
I'll just share this link as well, uh, typing.com. Tick, and the other link is.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Pbr.com. Okay.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:18:02.000
Yeah. And the other… thing that I want you, uh… take it further, is about your LinkedIn profile.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Take care. So, eventually, uh… Everybody… will be going, let's say, uh, will be applying for jobs.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:18.000
And then… For that, everybody checks your CV.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Cv, your name? Basically.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Basically, a page, a single page. That will, uh, you know, uh… will help the recruiters to know more about you.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:47.000
And eventually, they will be checking your profile as well. And profile clearly, they will not check your Instagram, or Facebook, or Snap, uh, Kikitna Streak score, Instagram post karte ho.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Ticket. For that, they will be checking your professional profile, and professional profile are… profiles are generally made on LinkedIn.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Yep.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:14.000
We're sorry to interrupt. I had a question. That the task for today is to complete all the… just, for example, you… there was written in typing.com, JNF, uh.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:19.000
We have to write it, so we have to complete all of the tasks that are given in that, uh, login ID.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:26.000
Uh, okay, so you will be sharing your progress of typing 3 times. We'll share forms, uh.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Three times in this month. In this training period, and you will have to upload your progress.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:44.000
Okay, so you just start typing it every day. Yeah, that's it. Yeah, uh, the next thing is, uh, your LinkedIn. So… For example, you post daily on Instagram.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:50.000
And people know what do you eat, where do you go, Akit Trip Kanti, aapkis country mein trip negay, theek hai.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:20:04.000
That thing. And that is only possible because you share that information on Instagram. You share that information on your own on this, uh… social media networks.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:10.000
Agar aflu sharehini karoge. If you don't share the information, people will not… know anything about you.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:26.000
And now, uh, your friend knows, kiapne kya khayaj. Similarly, about your skills. I don't know anything that what Omkar knows, what Suhani knows, what That chicken knows. I have no idea.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Because you haven't told it yet. Ticket.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Hannah, exactly. And diktase hamina apna rag kud kana barta hai. We have to, uh.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:45.000
We have to beat our own drums, basically. We have to tell people, uh, what exactly we know.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:59.000
And that is being… told through various mediums. We can… Use multiple mediums. For example, one is Uh, just to show that you have… you… your internship has started, your summer school internship program is started.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:08.000
For that, you can write a post. On LinkedIn, that you are, uh, basically, uh, you know, you have joined this summer school program, where you will be learning, uh.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Let's say if you've enrolled in WebD, so you will be learning about, uh, you know, how to build a scalable platforms, uh, using the MUN stack, or any stack that will be taught to you.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:29.000
And now you're excited to learn it. So what this post will do, this post will basically reflect two things.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:34.000
One is that you are now a part of IIT JAMU's summer, uh.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:43.000
School program. Second, that you've joined this program basically to upskill yourself. You must be doing something in the program.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Then you are also mentioning about your domain, about your, uh, let's say, WebD.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:58.000

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Hey guys, I'm, uh, just repeating some things in… I'm just… Repeating some things in Hindi.

So, one is that you have joined the summer school training program. Second is that you are doing something in the training. Third, you mentioned the WebD program. So that means you are learning something in web development, something about You know, uh, something about some tech stacks, and now you…

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:50.000
Basically, you're learning more about, you know, developing scalable platforms. So, let's say, uh, just this post come across, uh, some employers.

Do you know how to make this web app? How to make this platform?

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Tk. So that is only possible because you have shared that post.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:18.000
Chicken. For example, I'll teach AI how to make AI agents.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:30.000

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Pick it. Now, I'll come to the third part. Let's say, uh, we are not good at English.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:36:04.000
Co-issue. Now we have ChatGPT. But we should have some idea that what do we, uh… one… what do we want to write, uh… Add in our post. What do we want to write in our post?

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:19.000
And, uh, let's say, uh, I'll… Right? I want to write about, uh, uh… about this internship only. Let's say this summer school, that I have joined this summer school by IIT Jemu.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:23.000
Uh, which is being organized in our… collaboration with, uh, let's say, I3C and Techibal.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:29.000
And now I'm excited to learn what these guys, uh, have to, uh.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:37.000

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:58.000
So, I'll open ChatGPT. In this class, in the offline.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:07.000
Okay, I'll just start from scratch. Just… I'll just open this chat GPT.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:12.000
Obviously, I'll use incognito. Take care.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:19.000
Chatgpt. Yeah. I think everybody might have used chat GPTs.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:29.000
Let's say this is your first time. So, ChatGPT is a very, uh, nice chatbot, uh, offered by OpenAI.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:33.000
And Ektra say we have, uh… No, now we have a very good friend.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:41.000
Who can perform any instruction? In text, uh, that will, uh, tell it.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:46.000
And it is very good at executing the instructions.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:54.000
Just to give you some context, uh… Let's say I want to… Make a chair. From scratch.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:38:01.000
And if I don't know how to use hammer, I thought I can make a user actually say use nahi ba nahi.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:09.000
Similarly, if I don't know how to give instructions. To anyone, properly. What do I want from this?

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:16.000
I'll not be able to you know, uh, get the required results.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:26.000
So, ChatGPT is kind of a chatbot. It will follow our instructions, but our instructions, they… They have to be clear. What exactly do we want from this, uh, box?

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:34.000
This chat. We have a very good friend, but it only understands some clear instructions, that what exactly do we want from it?

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:48.000
Ticket. Uh, okay. For example, I'll just, you know, I'll just write a random, write, uh… letters… write a leave application. What they say, okay, but let's say. Write or leave application.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:56.000

Guys, do you know this is a chair? Yeah, can someone speak up quickly interactive style, Kasa?

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:29.000
Yes, so…

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:30.000
So your screen is not visible.

But how do you know this is a JS?

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:58.000
Because, sir, we have been taught either by our parents or by our school teachers in our school textbooks, that this is a shared. So, there is a relevant piece of information from which we can infer that This is a chair.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:02.000
Exactly. So, eventually, over the years, we have seen this multiple times.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:07.000
And our parents, our teachers, they have said that this is a chair.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:10.000
And if somebody asks us now, now we say, okay, this is chair now.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:15.000
2. Okay.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:25.000
This is also a chair. Right? Why? Because it has, uh, some, you know, uh… It has a base and a back support.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:30.000
And some leg, uh, which… supports this chair.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:34.000
So, there are some features that are attached to this chair.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:40.000
And that, uh, makes it a chair. Hannah? Bulgul Sayyna?

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:52.000
Chillo. Then that will scratch your mind.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:58.000
Kaya tierra?

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
No. Okay. Just okay.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:05.000
Yes, sir. That's a chair.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:12.000
Because it has a base. Some support, and it has some legs that supports it, huh?

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:18.000
Soga… right?

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:19.000
Hannah? To just put fun, uh, Hamlog Hathi bhi Bhair.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:25.000
Yes, sir.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:33.000
It has four legs, it has a base where we can sit, so is that a chair?

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:34.000
Yeah, so… Yeah. Is this a chair?

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:41.000
No, so that's technical audit here.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:42.000
Yes, sir, it can be considered as a chair.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:48.000
Because it has a base. Back, and some legs that supports it.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:53.000
And we can sit over it. So this is also chair. Ticket.

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:59.000
But then we'll come to the machine part, the machine language key. Okay, sir.

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:04.000
Is this a chair?

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:07.000
Yes, sir, it's also a jail.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:11.000
Seems like a chair, but… let's say, uh, if, uh, if I were… trust an access structure, but… can be considered cheers, you know?

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:22.000
Structure is of, uh…

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:23.000
Yeah, exactly. Yeah, so is this a… is… is this a… this a chair?

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:30.000
If we can sit on me, uh, maybe… It's not basic, but…

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:31.000
I don't know?

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:38.000
So it depends if this is a solid, then it can be used to sit, but if not, then it's not a chair.

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:39.000
It really depends on the state it is in.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:44.000
Okay. Exactly. If it is solid, then we… it seems like a chair. Now we're confused.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:58.000
Anna? First, in the first example, we were very much sure, okay, that will… was a chair, then we eventually came to different examples, like, examples, okay?

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:06.000
And then my mind kind of scratched off, kihayari chair, nahi hai, nah But if I were a machine.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:13.000
To classify. To make a bolta, the very first time that you asked.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:25.000
Uh, is this… is this a chair? To, let's say, I would have said, uh, that the chances of this being a chair is 60%.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:29.000
Uh, is… This a chair.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:39.000
Okay, yeah. Is this a chair? So… it will say, uh, yeah, the chances of this object being a chair is around 70%.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:48.000
And similarly, agar me is peyata. Which, as I was lucky, the chances of this object being a chair is 51%.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:53.000
Ticket. And it's able to share the volatility, chances are 40%.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:46:08.000
Machines could actually convey kartne hai. And they do this because, uh… We are very much… we are trained to basically identify the things which we are using since a long time.

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:19.000
From a long time. Take it, Amnibus, first example, Diktih Boldya, that that is a jail. We… at the very first moment, we… Confirmed, yeah, the first example is a chair.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:28.000
But, if eventually I asked you guys knew… examples, with new examples. I shared some new data.

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:43.000
And then you kind of fumbled, Kihara cheer hai nahi. In similar manner, machines also learn. Like, the way we are taught, okay, that is a chair, that is a table, fan.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:48.000
Podium bed. In similar way, machines are taught. And for machines.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:54.000
The data is a very big thing. Data. They are trained on the data.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:59.000
And na jadaat detaoga.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:06.000
Ticker. Yeah. So, this leave application request.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:11.000
Internet has been there, uh… Since a long time, isk both sa logo, ha?

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:16.000
So, over years, we have written, you know, multiple applications, you know.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:33.000
Uh, n number of applications, leave applications, application for, you know, uh, trip, application… leave application for, uh, due to fever, uh, some family reasons. Yes, Sabkuch internet pip… Over time, uh… collectogether. Take care.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:43.000
And over time, these so many applications, they were, you know, kind of, uh, uh, they formed a good database for machines to learn.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:49.000
From Tiger. Tika? Yeah.

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:58.000
They basically took all the data of internet, they took all these applications from the internet, and they fed all those into a machine.

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:04.000
And then how many machine goes to be trained kiya, and… machines, now they have learned.

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:14.000
Ticket. And now they will give us these, uh… formats these instructions, because the data was there on internet, and we have trained these machines on that data.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:22.000
We humans learn in the same manner, and Machines have learned in the same manner as well.

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:33.000
Pick it. Uh, I think a few of them joined you, uh, in the last session, and I was there. Uh, addressing the questions. So, one thing that I, uh.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:40.000
You know, mentioned is that everybody learns by imitating. Everybody learns by seeing what others do.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:44.000
At the very first time, I did not know how to use a knife.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:54.000
But then I saw someone using a knife. And then I basically saw it multiple times, and uske bhardi masika. Ikta said there was enough data to learn from.

01:48:54.000 --> 01:49:02.000
Ticket, and only then I, you know, caught some glimpses. Of now, I'm able to use Knife in a very fine manner.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:13.000
Driving cars, uh, writing on papers, everything is… learned by imitating others. Similarly, if you're preparing for any exam.

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:16.000
If you're learning a new skill, if you're learning any new concept in mathematics.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:31.000
Pick a… so that is also… learned by imitating, by seeing the examples which are already given, by, uh… But, you know, practicing the questions which are already given as examples, then exercise.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:42.000
We learn by imitating others. Take care. Yeah. I think I mentioned this in the last class as well.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:50.000
So, let's say if there is any concept. Very much new to us. Just say a weird chairs team, these are very much new.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:50:08.000
But the very first time, we basically saw them. And we interacted, we kind of gave some more time to it, and eventually now we know that, okay, this is a chair, and if I see it next time, I'll be able to identify that this is Jair.

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:18.000
Take it. Take care. I think the concept is basically we learn by implitting others, and we learn Uh, but of course, we also learned with some data.

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:30.000
And machines, they also lend me the data. And over time, internet pitna data collectatha, and we… fed all the data which was collected over the years on the internet into a machine.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:44.000
And now we have ChatGPT, uh. And Gemini, Meta AI, uh… deep sick and AI models. Okay. They basically trained these machines, uh.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:51.000
On the data. Train kise Hawaii, and who… that part is different. But, yeah, kuch asahi, usahi machines, uh… Yeah, please.

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:59.000
So… Yeah, so… so basically, uh, we learn by imitating.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:00.000
Yeah.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:06.000
And we develop a… rough mental image about something.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:14.000
For instance, if it is a ball, then we feel that, okay, something which has a round shape is a bulb.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:32.000
Now, there are objects which have round shape, but they are not walls. So, as Our mind comes across things like oranges and watermelon, which are also of round shape, but they… not share any characteristics of a ball. The range of information or…

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:36.000
Vin has increases, and so that is how our knowledge increases.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:39.000
So, did I get… did I get the concept right?

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:48.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah, the very first time you saw a bowl, now, after that, you saw a watermelon. You also thought that this is also a bowl, a bigger bowl.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:52:05.000
But then you threw it, and food here. Then you came to know, okay, this is watermelon. This is something different. Now, your brain has taken that knowledge, and if you see a watermelon next time, then you will be able to identify, okay, uh, this is something different

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:15.000
From the bone. Take care. Cello. I think, uh, now you have a very good idea how machines learn, how humans learn.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:25.000
Just to, uh, I'll just take two more minutes on this concept. Uh, let's say if you're preparing For any exam, if you are preparing for any interview, if you're preparing for any company, a coding round.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:31.000
If you're learning a new skill. There, also, this concept applies.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:37.000
Let's say I was preparing for J exam, J…

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:41.000
Yeah. I was… Preparing for my J exam.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:47.000
Take care. Yeah. And… there were many concepts which were hard.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:59.000
Take a starting minute, they were hard. But the very first time, my faculty, my teachers, they taught me, uh, how these concepts work, how to solve questions of these concepts.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:08.000
Together. And eventually. I sold examples. Let's say, at very first time, I did not get how to solve these questions.

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:14.000
Then I sold some more examples. I sold more, more, more, more, and I kept on selling more examples.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:22.000
And eventually, I get to, uh, I went… I know, I reached to a point where I can… solve the questions of that concept.

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:40.000
If they come in any format, any manner. Similarly, you will be coming across many, uh, different, uh, you know, uh.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:45.000
Okay, guys, first class, eh? Christians, Raku. Take care.

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:52.000
You're from Fortier Achivate. Don't worry. Yeah.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:56.000
To ultimately, uh, how to learn, basically just spend time on the things.

01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:01.000
Pick it. And, uh, Vese, which is a strategy. Take it.

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:12.000
If you're enrolled in this program, please have patience. We have a way of teaching, and we'll cover the concept in that way only. And the full curriculum that we've mentioned, uh, in the program, that will be covered.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:17.000
But tickets are patients referral. If you're imported, good thing.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:25.000
Yeah. So, uh… Application Lika. Now, I'll move to an article, let's say, uh… write an article.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:35.000
On… importance of… importance.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:39.000
Of training. Ai models.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:44.000
Enlightenment.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:49.000
Ticket. In… 300 words.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:54.000
Yeah. And then you can also specify what tone it should be.

01:54:54.000 --> 01:55:10.000
Tone can be casual, uh, formal, and, like, any tone. Take care. And why… this, uh, tool… It's writing in this way, because it has been trained to write in this manner.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Ticket. I think the concept is clear now. Take it. Yeah. So, similarly, you can also, uh… create PPTs.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:26.000
To now create… I'll just show you the use cases that can be done with this.

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:35.000
Now create, uh, first we'll start with the LinkedIn post. Yeah. So we initially started with… started with this, uh, this post.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:50.000
Okay. So, I wanted to write a post about… I recently… joined… Ayati Jammuz.

01:55:50.000 --> 01:56:03.000
Somewhat of… summer school program. Let's say, uh, my domain is, uh, AI.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:08.000
And… Roljamin, some more. Willems?

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:14.000
Ai agents… Yeah. Uh, I'm excited.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:25.000
If there's a mistake, uh, don't worry, in these words, this tool will identify, and it will eventually Yeah. I'm excited.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:31.000
To learn and explore. New concepts.

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:38.000
You can also mention something, let's say, about, uh…

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:59.000
Okay, let's keep this very short. And I… now, this is the con… context. Before asking, uh… before asking this tool to, you know, uh, write something. We basically first give context to it. And… about what we are, uh, talking. And now, I'll ask…

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:04.000
This to perform some action, and that will be, uh, rank… write a LinkedIn post.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:10.000
Write a LinkedIn post. Using above content.

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:19.000
Ticket. Let's say in 300 words. Will write a long post. Check it.

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:29.000
Yeah. So it will write a post in 300 words.

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:35.000
And your task will be to edit this, and then ultimately, uh, post this on LinkedIn.

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:45.000
Let's say, uh, there are multiple ways to edit this. Either you can use OpenAI's Canvas, or you can edit this in Canvas, you can edit this error only. Okay.

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:48.000
I think for that, it will ask us to log in.

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:53.000
Okay, yeah. Yeah. You can edit the text, let's say I want to remove this last time.

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:59.000
You can use this, uh… canvas of ChatGPT.

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:06.000
The other way is to use… The other way is to use… Google Docs, which I use for my post.

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:17.000
So I'll just copy this post from here. And I will open… a Google Doc document.

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:26.000
Corporate premise. Google Docs.

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:34.000
Blank document.

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:42.000
Yeah, and paste, but whatever you copied. And many people, they forget to remove these additional lines.

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:46.000
And words, ticket. Please make sure that you remove these lines.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:52.000
Take care.

01:58:52.000 --> 01:59:01.000
Also, add hashtags. Uh, content is there, hashtag is there, uh, heading is there. But LinkedIn does not recognize this, uh.

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:07.000
Formatting this bold, uh… it direct, let's say, I'll do some text as italic.

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:13.000
And now I'll just copy this full text, I'll paste this on LinkedIn.

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:20.000
And now. Take care. You come here.

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:24.000
Oh, excuse me, sir?

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:25.000
Yep, please.

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:26.000
So, I have a question, may I…

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:29.000
You can ask the question that someone asked me.

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:48.000
So you said that we have mailed tons of applications to, um, our concerning individuals via via the internet, and basically, ChatGPT has utilized that information to create a database. So, sir.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:59.000
And email is a private conversation, right? So, how exactly does the internet get access to our private conversation and feed it into ChatGPT's database?

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:05.000
Uh, we'll come to that part, uh, you know, about data privacy concerns later.

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:16.000
But let's say many have… they have written articles on internet, uh, how to write, uh, good leave application. They've mentioned many samples on the internet.

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:22.000
People have used those to train. But we'll come on this, because this is not a part of, uh.

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:29.000
This class, and eventually we'll be Discussing about the bias, data privacy, and all those concerns. Take it. But for now, let's focus on LinkedIn.

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:34.000
And the basic gist was to give you some idea that how my machines learn.

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:40.000
While ChatGPT is showing, uh, the content in this manner. How we, as humans, learn.

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:49.000
Okay. Yeah. So, uh… We have added some text, but if you see on the screen, this seems very cluttered.

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
And I think this might be putting some strain on your eye.

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:52.000
Hello? Sir?

02:00:52.000 --> 02:01:00.000
On the plane. Yeah, please. And if I add some spaces, I have to please, please ask, ask your question, yeah.

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:07.000
I have no questions, I have a meeting at 7 to 7.30.

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:12.000
Can I go to attend the meeting? As in, I am the CR of my class.

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:17.000
Pastor Representative. So that I'm meeting.

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:20.000
Of course, you can leave if you want, but try to schedule those meetings.

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:23.000
How… how much are…

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:37.000
Okay, woe meeting, you can discuss those later. But this, uh, craft will not come again. So just… try to manage both, uh, you know, in the, uh… some time frames. Take care. Now, guys, see this post.

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:50.000
Now, this seems more, you know, pleasing to my eyes. Uh, no space was there. And this was putting strain on my eyes.

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:56.000
But, okay. But I added… I added some.

02:01:56.000 --> 02:02:03.000
Space. And ye… local tenure, basically.

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:15.000
And now, this post… looks good, and pleasing to my eyes. Take care. Second, this is… but ye bold haine.

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:26.000
If you'll post, it will remove the for meetings. To escalate, there comes a very good tool, uh, Uska Naimit Type Grow. Take care. But before that.

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:35.000
Uh, since, let's say, if you're new to LinkedIn, and you will be having, uh, very less connections, very less followers.

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:48.000
So your post will not have required reach. And LinkedIn's algorithm has, you know, a very good, uh, networking a re… a way to get more reach.

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:52.000
Basically, if you post your stories on LinkedIn, uh, on Instagram.

02:02:52.000 --> 02:03:11.000
And you tag someone. Now that person shares Uh, you're… Yeah. Shares your story in their, uh… their account. Okay, so eventually, people… Eventually, your story will be getting more reach.

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:16.000
Because you mentioned someone else, and now the person has shared the post.

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:22.000
Just basic networking algorithm, take it. Similarly, in this, uh, post.

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:28.000
Whatever you will post about summer school, or about your skills, you will be tagging a lot of your mentors.

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:43.000
Your friends, your school, uh, uh, sorry, school, not school, but college difficulties, your college, so your reach is, uh… So you reach of this post increases. For example, I'll add, uh, let's say, uh, emptier rinser.

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:54.000
I'm de Arvin, sir. Mt urban? Yeah I'll also add Shubham Gore be at M, G.

02:03:54.000 --> 02:04:08.000
I'll also tag IIT Jamun, because IIT Jammu has more than 30,000-40,000 followers So, I'll type Indian Institute… Indian… I-N-D, Indian Institute of Technology, yeah.

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:17.000
And let's say, uh, your friends, I am a friend of Parameters, so I'll, uh… I'll tag parameters.

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:31.000
Pick it. So you can add other… your peers from your, uh, summer school program. Take care. And this… this thing will help us a lot in, uh, getting reach.

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:35.000
Getting acknowledged by other people, getting acknowledged by recruiters over time.

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:41.000
Both important step, eh? And the other thing is also add a picture to this.

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:47.000
Hamishaik Media Edgarthus mein. Because this will, uh, make the post interactive.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:51.000
Take care. Yeah, so I'll just select a random picture. Cuppies.

02:04:51.000 --> 02:05:05.000
Excuse me, sir? Oh, sorry, yeah, sir, like, for writing LinkedIn posts, is it… okay to be so much dependent on artificial intelligence, because it would… wouldn't it hamper the creativity of human minds? Like.

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:06.000
Make it propagand.

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:14.000
Ah, yes, you can write full post on your own, no issue. I'm just telling you a very short and easy way to write a post.

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
Of course, you can write the post, full content on your own.

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:23.000
Then in this photo, if you don't want to show that you have tagged someone directly in your post.

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:31.000
You can tag people here, and this will not be shown in the content of your post, but it will also… it will tag people.

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:35.000
Take care. Ed. Pick, and next.

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:49.000
Wo aapke photometa coin. And this is also a good way to tag more people. If you don't want to show their names in this content.

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:50.000
Sir, can you repeat the process?

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:58.000
Okay. And then we also… yeah. Our content is ready, uh, our… First, the content which we, uh… created using ChatGPT. You can write… your own content, that is the step one.

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:03.000
The tag one.

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:15.000
Step 2 is basically tagging people, or tagging relevant people. You can also tag Google. If you… if you… If you are using a Google tool, you can tag Google, you can also tag OpenAI, you can tag Chat…

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:21.000
So, really sorry to interrupt, but there was a network issue. Can you repeat the steps?

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:27.000
Okay, I'm just repeating steps only. First is you add the text.

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:36.000
Then the… people that you want to tag in this post, you can also tag the owners of the tools, the creators of the tools.

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:46.000
For example, Google OpenAI, Q.ai, because people No, they keep on, uh… Because many people follow Google, uh.

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:50.000
Google's LinkedIn account. So your post will also reach to those people.

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:56.000
To reach Baranaka ye both say tariqar. If you… if you, if you tag a lot of people.

02:06:56.000 --> 02:07:08.000
Okay, so always try to tag IT Gemu. Any other IIT, uh, other IAMs, if the… project is in management, you can take IAMs. If the project is about low.

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:21.000
You can tag national law schools, just, you know, those. Together. And then you can also, uh… try to always add a photo, because this will… increase the interaction with the post.

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:29.000
And then you can add people in, uh, you've… photo as well. Take care. Now, you can post this, uh, post.

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:40.000
Just click on post, and it will be posted, but you… let's say, uh… you're writing this post at night, okay? So you can schedule this post for later as well.

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:45.000
I want to post this on 19th. Let's say at 7.30 AM.

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:53.000
Ticket. And now, next, and your post will be scheduled. A similar feature is available in the mails, uh, Gmail account. Take care.

02:07:53.000 --> 02:08:03.000
To GHEs, uh, you can do. And I think this, uh, schedule for later is… I think, available for one photo only, one photo post.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:12.000
Ticket. Click on post, it will be posted. Now your second job will be to interact.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:20.000
With others post. Let's say, uh, Quiposte, up names to like, yeah, uh, you… Uh, basically, uh.

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:26.000
Karo, wokaro. Tiger.

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:36.000
Because people, they replicate. If the very, uh, you know, one thing that I, uh, take care of, and that I do, uh.

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:45.000
Personally, is when there are very less comments in a post, I… intentionally add a comment on that post.

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:55.000
Because I'm doing something extra, and the person I always get this, uh, that someone viewed your profile, and whenever I check it, uh, the person is the same.

02:08:55.000 --> 02:09:04.000
Ticket. Because people… they basically, uh, are kind of, you know, they have hunger, you know, for recognition, uh.

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:12.000
For, uh, appreciation. So, if we appreciate people, others will also appreciate us. And if we do some… something extra.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:19.000
So, that will help us, uh. For example, see, only 9 to 10 likes. If I add a like here, and I add a comment.

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:32.000
This comment will also be shown in this post. And it will also increase Okay. Launching 2. You can just mention, yeah, uh, uh, seems good.

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:38.000
A good initiative. Good initiative.

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:42.000
Really excited for it. Really ex…

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:48.000
Sir, basically, we can say that, uh, we can… Increase the engagement of the course so that others also get aware of our profile.

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:53.000
Exec. Exactly. Exactly, exactly.

02:09:53.000 --> 02:10:06.000
Initiative. Begin. And these… try to add comments when there are less comments. Because that will increase… against post-deco, na.

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:12.000
Is postcore. So you may comment, ki aari kon Hajisne keya comment aid kiwa.

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:18.000
And this will basically give me more visibility. Kuyagar is supposed to check karaga.

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:23.000
I will already be there. Okay, so try to do something extra.

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:36.000
So, this is all about LinkedIn. Eventually, we will also be using some browser extensions, but our beaches , The job is to post at least, uh.

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:48.000
5 times a week. Learning whatever you're learning, and let's say if you've done any course, uh, yeah, for those who have mentioned that they have… they don't have any skill, they are not doing something.

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:59.000
You can mention about your courses, your college courses, that currently I'm pursuing this course in my college, and this course is about, uh, you know, let's say, uh, DSA, uh.

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:12.000
Algorithms, and I'm learning this in my course. You can mention about that. Because there is always something that you can mention. If not your skills, you can mention about the thing that you're enrolled in.

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:18.000
The courses in which you are enrolled. So just try to keep mentioning.

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:31.000
On this, uh. Type of platform, the Wobiap apna use ka start then. You can mention those things as well, that my typing has increased to this. Over time has increased to this.

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:32.000
Ticket. So, this is, uh…

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:41.000
So, is it possible? That we can post, like, what we learn in today's classes, like in IAT.

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:42.000
So, in 18 summer school. Am I audible, sir?

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:48.000
Sorry, sorry. Yeah, please, just repeat once, yeah.

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:55.000
So, actually, I was asking that, is it possible that, uh, every decision we had, we can also post about it?

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:56.000
Exit… you can take a screenshot, and then you can post it in this class. We learned about this.

02:11:56.000 --> 02:12:01.000
That's what we learned.

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
We explored some new tools, we explored some new concepts. Okay, that will add… Yeah.

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:11.000
Okay. So is it, uh… Is it allowed? So, am I able to take a screenshot? Is it allowed?

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:19.000
Uh-oh! You're free, malam. But the only thing is, uh, we are not so sure about the recordings, whether, uh.

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:20.000
Okay.

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:28.000
I think Roomsa will interact with you after this session, but you are free to take screenshots and you can Yeah, you can use those on LinkedIn, no.

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:29.000
Thank you so much.

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:36.000
The other thing is that you have to search people, uh, let's say, uh, I want to search software developers.

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:41.000
Software developers. Just a basic random search.

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:51.000
Ticket. And then there are Jove's Post, people, services, groups, courses, and a lot of things. I'll look for people.

02:12:51.000 --> 02:13:08.000
And I want people in… In India, let's say in India, in, uh… In India, and… and then I can add more… More on this. I want people in, let's say, in, let's say, uh, in Delhi.

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:25.000
Location.

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:31.000
I'll just do a refresh.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:42.000
The other thing is, uh, that you have to reach out to other people. Where do you want to go? In which… Uh, which company, uh, that you, you know, want to, uh, do a job at.

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:46.000
I think… so you just connect with similar people in the domain. Take care.

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:54.000
Let's say, uh, I'll type Delhi. Take a Delhi, India Mameco software developers, uh, search karne.

02:13:54.000 --> 02:14:10.000
So I'll connect with people here on this platform. Take it, I'll just… you can search people in your area, search people in Bangalore, in that com… And you can also search a company also. You can search a company as well. Let's say I want to apply for Microsoft.

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:17.000
So, it is always better to, uh. Connect with people from that company in advance.

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:27.000
Eventually, you can ask them for referrals, you can ask them for roadmaps, how did they correct that job? Hiring ground may kyahota hai.

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:33.000
Okay, so you can ask all this question from these people. Take care. Let's say I'll connect with these people.

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:34.000
Ah, yeah.

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:40.000
Sir, I'm having certain network issues. Can I just leave and join, if that's okay?

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:48.000
Yeah, please, yes, yes, yeah. Uh, just to, uh, give you some… okay, uh, yes.

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:54.000
There are two ways to send a connection request, one without a note, and second, you can just add a note.

02:14:54.000 --> 02:15:02.000
And since LinkedIn has given this option, that means this… this note will help us to stand out. Cookie log node need out there.

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:07.000
Okay, let's say, uh, hi, uh, I… hello, okay, uh, Justin, yeah.

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:13.000
Hello, Jaskiran. I came across your profile.

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:20.000
Again, across your profile. Cross your profile.

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:24.000
Uh, looking forward to connect. Looking forward to connect.

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:33.000
To connect and have some… Sorry. Insightful.

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:44.000
Insightful, uh, discussions. Too good. If you met someone in a conference in a… in some event, so you can also mention that thing as well.

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:53.000
That would… that will also help us know, uh. Give… that… that will give us some visibility, and that person will accept our request.

02:15:53.000 --> 02:16:01.000
Ticket-based deal. Ticket. And the other way is just… connect, send without a note.

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:06.000
And eventually, you will see the difference in… Both these methods. Okay.

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:12.000
Yeah, so one is this thing. Yeah. Then we also have first, second, third.

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:18.000
Uh, you know, first is basically, uh, our own, uh, followers.

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:25.000
In our own circle, immediate circle. Second is Job apne fodorse unke followers, the followers of our followers.

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:31.000
Tiger. Third is… Polaros que followers que followers.

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:34.000
Okay, so there are three levels which you can, uh, reach out.

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:45.000
Together. And this also helps us narrow down the people. Take care. So please try to, uh, add try to, you know, send, uh.

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:54.000
3-4 connections at least a week, or at least a day. I basically max out my connections, uh, of… That's what my weekly connections.

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:59.000
Begin. And this thing will help you land a very good job.

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:07.000
Eventually. Take it? It is a karnat seh. Okay, I think, uh, for now, uh, this much is good, uh, for LinkedIn.

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:18.000
Pick it. Yeah. And after this, uh, we'll move to… ChatGPT only for Skarifeng Bhar.

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:21.000
As previously said, I have one question regarding LinkedIn. Uh, sir, there is an option of easy apply and job application like that.

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:28.000
Yeah, please. Yeah, you guys can…

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:29.000
So…

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:37.000
Will basically… Oh, easy apply is, uh, something that, uh, has been introduced on LinkedIn.

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:42.000
And if your profile is complete, uh, let's say, uh, my name is added, my, uh.

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:50.000
Learning field is added, my… education background, my, uh, certifications, everything is added.

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:56.000
So I would be able to use that feature well.

02:17:56.000 --> 02:18:05.000
Yeah, so I can always use Easy Apply. Just try to use Easy Apply. Actually, Easy Apply. Just once click on it and see what happens.

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:06.000
Okay. The…

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:11.000
Hello, sir, uh, what, uh, what step did you mention after the node?

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:16.000
You, uh, mentioned about the note option and the LinkedIn. Was there any other step?

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:17.000
After this?

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:28.000
Yeah. No, no, no, no, no. After node V, basically, so, uh, you know, the levels of people that we interact with. First level, Joe, immediate group may hai, then apne group ke jo, wo, and then unke dos joke.

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:34.000

Okay, friend, and then later on, unke befriended. Ticket. So we use this feature. You have to use this feature, and let's say, uh, I am working in GYUX domain.

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:52.000
Okay. Though, I would be looking for people, those who are designers, you know, like-minded. Let's say I want to work at Google.

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:58.000
To Google me, jitnei Bhi UI UX designer hai sabko connection request based luma.

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:04.000
I'll also send some requests to people of Microsoft. To people of Meta. Basically, in these domains.

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:11.000
Okay, and then I'll also target… I'll also target HR managers.

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:21.000

02:23:47.000 --> 02:24:08.000
Yeah, just a second.

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:12.000
So, this is the interface of ChatGPT, uh, that you have seen.

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:21.000
Pretty good. Of course, Abu Chattukartinga. And the other things that I want to highlight is basically, uh.

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:27.000
That you can create PPTs in this. You know, basically, whatever you can do with text.

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:38.000
You can do this with ChatGPT. Take option here, let's say I want to create I want to create… a pitch deck, a pitch deck.

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:48.000
Which deck, uh, own, uh. We pitched that short hain. I want to create PPT on, uh, importance of learning AI.

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:53.000
Take it. Learning AI. Let me, uh, ticket.

02:24:53.000 --> 02:25:05.000
In 20 slides, in 10 slides. And Jay Hameik at content dilega. It will give, uh, some good content on… Take care.

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:10.000
Yeah, replicate those 10 slides. Okay, but I… what I want to tell you is.

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:14.000
That I can customize what exactly I want on each slide.

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:20.000
Ticket. Whatever instruction I will give, uh, GA or SARA instructions.

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:28.000
Okay, cooling facial there.

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:38.000
Yeah. You know. Again, the slide was now click there. But what do I want? I want, uh, uh, two, uh, headings.

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:50.000
And when… one line of explanation In every slide.

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:58.000
The other way is that you have a PPT, and you upload the PPT here, and then you ask questions. Kipt good enough, eh?

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:14.000
Ppt, uh, uh, let's say, uh. Meets the criteria of that competition. Examically, they declare heading, and then one line of Explanation. You can be more, you know, a specific line ki hai.

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:19.000
This is called prompt, and prompt can be as long as you want it.

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:24.000
To give the context.

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:30.000
That they'll take it. It is always better to give more context So that it can answer us in a better way.

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:36.000
Yeah. The other thing that I want to show is that you can attach files and photos here.

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:39.000
You can attach your PPDs, you can attach your Excel sheets.

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:44.000
And you can, you know, uh… do some data interpretation.

02:26:44.000 --> 02:27:11.000
Data analysis here with ChatGPT. You can attach a PDF files, and you can ask it Uh, to perform, uh, some… particular… Redux, Python, and AI, and one… Okay, I think I'm not able to… get any…

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:16.000
We'll give… let's say we have some, uh, data here. We have some excellus, uh, file.

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:29.000
But you can use this chat GPT, uh, let's say, uh, give me a… Give me a summary of this data.

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:34.000
Summary of this data. Coach, do you get institutions, Joyce Mayor?

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:39.000

Yeah, your domains will be covered eventually. Jb are both important. Take it.

02:27:51.000 --> 02:28:00.000
But it has given us the overview, uh, of… the data. Eventually, data science may be upload, uh.

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:06.000
Ai tools use Karoga to analyze the data. Ticket, and capture missing information, KKS meadar nah.

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:18.000
Okay, yeah. So now, let's say, uh, I want to… I want a particular entry, or I want data in a particular format, in a particular table.

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:36.000

The other thing is that you can use other apps. You can connect your… Google Drive and Vase, you can connect with documents, Google Docs.

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:32.000
And then you can query the documents, you can ask more questions about that document.

Yes. Settings. Settings may… we have some personalization.

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:34.000
Basically, Yahira, memory is key, eh? Memory, uh, reference saved memories. First, it basically… whatever you chat, uh, whatever you add, whatever you give the data to this.

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:41.000
It will learn the data, and it will form a picture about you, about your work.

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:57.000
Jobhi apluk chario. Think hai? And basically, over time, it will… It will learn about those. And now, if I ask.

02:32:57.000 --> 02:33:03.000
About, let's say, what is summer school? So, it will, you know, uh… Okay.

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:07.000
Sir, could you please show this tape once again?

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:13.000
So, in settings, uh, in settings, we have… personalization here.

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:21.000
Here, it is, uh, having some memory. Memory, basically, let ChatGPT save and use memories when responding.

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:24.000
And you can manage this memory, you can turn off this feature.

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:28.000
What it does is that it basically learns from your, uh.

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:41.000
Chats that you do it with… that you do with the chat board. And if you ask any question from this, it will, you know, basically go back into the history, and now then it will be able to, uh.

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:55.000
Bring back that exact text. Or exact context ki aap uske se spanaim baat karate, theek hai. So, over time, it will have a good, uh… memory of yours. Let's say if there's any particular style of typing, a particular style of

02:33:55.000 --> 02:34:03.000
Writing. So, it will grasp that style, ki aapkis tera se document dikto, in what manner do you write the documents?

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:17.000
And eventually, when you will ask the charitable that, uh, use my, uh, use, uh, the manner in which I write, use the tone that I prefer, and now write this article. So it will… write the document in that particular style.

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:31.000

Other domains. Then there are connected apps. You can connect to Google Drive, Microsoft Drive.

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:48.000
And through security here, packages here. But one thing that I wanted to cover is this map.

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:55.000
Memory part. Next is that we can share this chat with anyone.

We can basically assign any role to ChatGPT. Let's say I want it to be a mentor, uh, I wanted it to be an industry expert, working in some particular domain.

02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:30.000
Pyoki, because we have used a lot of data to train this board.

02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:45.000

Now, he will become that person, and then… It will write the, uh, the document in that manner.

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:41.000
Let's say this has scored us, uh, on the criteria. Then it has given some summary. Let's say, uh, I can ask the feedback, uh, where can I improve?

02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:49.000

You are feeding a text to it, and now it is generating text again.
